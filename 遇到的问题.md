slash in windows `c:\path`(using forward slash), in unix or mac`/mnt/path/c`(using backslash)

# Java

==问题：无法显示java --version==

<u>解决方式</u>：`java -version`

# python

==问题：在git自带的mingw中无法使用`python`命令==

<u>解决方式</u>

在mingw64终端中输入`alias python='winpty python.exe'`

但是重启终端时就失效了。如果希望每次启动终端时都有效，则需要在`.bash_profile`文件中(此文件通常在`c/Users/你的用户名`目录下)添加命令`alias python='winpty python.exe'`

如果你的系统中同时安装了python 2.x和python 3.x，并且把exe重命名为了python2.exe和python3.exe，则需要在`.bash_profile`中添加

```bash
alias python2='winpty python2.exe'
alias python3='winpty python3.exe'
```

# Ubuntu

==问题：在windows系统下安装Ubuntu时控制台出现如下问题：==

>Installing, this may take a few minutes...
WslRegisterDistribution failed  with error: 0x8007019e
The Windows Subsystem for Linux optional component is  not enabled. Please enable it and try again.
See https://aka.ms/wslinstall  for details.
Press any key to continue...


解决方法：

**控制面板–程序与功能–启动或关闭Windows功能勾选适用于Linux的Windows子系统**，重启即可

或

**设置–更新和安全–开发者选项**

==问题：在虚拟机Ubuntu20.04中vim输入i无法进入编辑模式==

解决方法：

```bash
-- 步骤一，输入下述命令以卸载vim-tiny：
sudo apt-get remove vim-common
-- 步骤二，输入下述命令以安装vim-full：
sudo apt-get install vim
-- 修改/etc/vim/vimrc.tiny 文件，将set compatible设置成set nocompatible，保存退出即可。这是因为有时候系统会默认vim兼容vi，所以使用vi的命令，在使用i可以进入插入模式，当按下Esc的时候退出到命令模式
```

补充：Ubuntu最好装上gcc和make，不然有makefile的c程序无法运行

```bash
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install net-tools // 这个是使用netstat，选装
```

## Difference between framework vs Library vs IDE vs API vs SDK vs Toolkits?

An **IDE** is an integrated development environment - a suped-up text editor with additional support for developing (such as forms designers, resource editors, etc), compiling and debugging applications. e.g Eclipse, Visual Studio.

A **Library** is a chunk of code that you can call from your own code, to help you do things more quickly/easily. For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all that code for yourself. Typically a library will only offer one area of functionality (processing images or operating on zip files)

An **API** (application programming interface) is a term meaning the functions/methods in a library that you can call to ask it to do things for you - the interface to the library.

An **SDK** (software development kit) is a library or group of libraries (often with extra tool applications, data files and sample code) that aid you in developing code that uses a particular system (e.g. extension code for using features of an operating system (Windows SDK), drawing 3D graphics via a particular system (DirectX SDK), writing add-ins to extend other applications (Office SDK), or writing code to make a device like an Arduino or a mobile phone do what you want). An SDK will still usually have a single focus.

A **toolkit** is like an SDK - it's a group of tools (and often code libraries) that you can use to make it easier to access a device or system... Though perhaps with more focus on providing tools and applications than on just code libraries.

A **framework** is a big library or group of libraries that provides many services (rather than perhaps only one focussed ability as most libraries/SDKs do). For example, .NET provides an application framework - it makes it easier to use most (if not all) of the disparate services you need (e.g. Windows, graphics, printing, communications, etc) to write a vast range of applications - so one "library" provides support for pretty much everything you need to do. Often a framework supplies a complete base on which you build your own code, rather than you building an application that consumes library code to do parts of its work.

There are of course many examples in the wild that won't exactly match these descriptions though.
